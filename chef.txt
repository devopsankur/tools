what is chef?
==============
A)-chef is an automation platform that configures and manages your infrastructure 
whether infrastructure it is on-premises or in the cloud.
B)-it turns your infrastructure as code i.e  your computing environment has some of 
the same attributes as your application.
   -your infrastructure is versionable
   -your infrastructure is repeatable
   -your infrastructure is testable
C)-You only need to tell chef what the desired configuration should be, not how to achieve it.

Note:
-----
How chef is smart ?
scenario: if we have to install apache in windows, redhat, ubuntu so for installation apache 
in these different platform different commands should be used. 
how chef helps: we have to tell chef hey i have to install apache. no need to tell how to 
install chef is smart it will install.

The chef Solution:
==================
Nodes:
============
-Nodes are the actual servers(blocks) where you want to apply configuration.
-Nodes are the ends point

Chef Server:
============
-Deploy configuration to chef server

Local Workstation:
==================
-Laptop/desktop should be Workstation.
-i will write chef configure in Workstation
(Write code that describes the state of a node)

Chef tools and ternimologies:
=============================

Chef Workstation: 
*****************
The location from which users do most of their work.

Node:
*********
A node is any machine that is under management by Chef.
  -physical
  -Virtual
  -cloud
  -network device etc.

Chef Server:
************
Acts as a hub for configuration data and store cookbooks, policies that are applied to Nodes
and related metadata. 

Chef Client:
************
An agent that runs locally on every node that is under management by Chef to bring the node
into the expected state.

Knife:
***********
Tool that provides an interface between a local chef-repo and the chef server and help users 
to manage.
  -Nodes, Cookbooks, Recipes , Roles, environment

Ohio:
***********
Tool that is used to detect attributes on a node, and then provide these attributes to the 
chef client at the start of every chef-cleint run
-Platform and Network details
-CPU data and kernel data 
-Memory usage & other configuration details

Resources:
***********
Resources is anything you want to change/configure in the host.
-Files
-Dirs 
-Users & Groups
-Packages and Services

Recipe:
***********
Resources are gathered in to a file which is called as recipe which ensures the system is in
desired state. 
-Domain specific language(DSL) used by Chef & are actually just a subset of Ruby.

Cookbook:
***********
The fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution
-Each cookbook defines a scenario, such as everything needed to install and configure MYSQL
-Then it containes all the components that are required to support that scenario.
